/*
STRING SPECS

Given a string that is a sequence of numbers followed by dash followed by text, eg: 23-ab-48-caba-56-haha

-The numbers can be assumed to be unsigned integers
-The strings can be assumed to be ASCII sequences of arbitrary length larger than 0 (empty strings not allowed).

TASK 1

-Before implementing the needed function, please estimate the difficulty of the functions and report the
estimated and the used time to implement the functions in the function comment block.

-Write a function testValidity that takes the string as an input, and returns boolean flag true if the given
string complies with the format, or false if the string does not comply

-Write a function averageNumber that takes the string, and returns the average number from all the numbers

-Write a function wholeStory that takes the string, and returns a text that is composed from all the text
 words separated by spaces, e.g. story called for the string 1-hello-2-world should return text: "hello world"

 -Write a function storyStats that returns four things:
	-the shortest word
	-the longest word
	-the average word length
	-the list (or empty list) of all words from the story that have the length the same as the average length rounded up and down.
